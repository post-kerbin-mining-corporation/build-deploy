# Configuration

There are four configuration files that should be edited to configure the mod:

* `.mod_data.yml`: Customize mod information
* `GameData/ModNameHere/Versioning/ModNameHere.version`: Customize the mod version
* `.travis.yml`: Customize the deployment scripts
* `.ksp_deploy_config.yml`: Customize advanced options

## `.mod_data.yml`
This file stores mod-specific information about how to deploy. Here you specify your dependencies for packaging and your deploy targets.
It is broken down into a few sections

### mod-name

This is the name of your mod, which should match the folder name in GameData. Zips will be named according to this as well.

### package

This controls the packaging of the mod

* `include-dependencies`: whether to package the dependencies as well
* `included-gamedata`: if you have multiple GameData-level items in your distribution, specify them here
* `included-support`: if you have multiple root-level items in your distribution, specify them here. This could be things like changelogs, license files, etc

### dependencies**

This section specifies dependenceis to bundle with the mod. 

A dependency block starts with the name of the dependency.
```
CryoTanks:
  location: s3
  version: 2.6.0  
```
 The most important field is the `location` item, which specifies where to fetch this dependency from. There are three possible values:

`s3`
This specifies that the dependency should be pulled from S3. It will be pulled from the S3 bucket specified in `.ksp_deploy_config.yml`. These items should be zipped with a structure that looks like `GameData/Dependency/Stuff` You should also specify:
* `version`: A string that will be appended to the mod name to collect the appropriate zip file, eg `CryoTanks_2.6.0.zip`

`github`
This specifies that the dependency should be a repository cloned from Github with a specific tag. These dependencies should have a root level `GameData` folder containing the dependency. You should also specify:
* `repository`: The org and name of the repo, eg 'ChrisAdderley/CryoTanks'
* `tag`: The tag that should be collected. Make sure to check that the tag exists.

`url`
This specifies that the dependency is pulled from a simple URL. This can either be a zipfile, like the S3 one described above, or a simple flat single file (eg. a dll). You should also specify:
* `url`: The URL of the file
* `zip`: True if this is a zip, packaged as `GameData/Dependency/Stuff`

### deploy

This section provides a list of deploy targets. Each can be enabled or disabled by changing the `enabled` flag. Currently 3 are supported.

`SpaceDock`
Deploy to Spacedock. You must supply a `mod-id` which is the numeric ID, as indicated in the SpaceDock URL. You must ensure the SpaceDock credentials are setup correctly (see [Getting Started](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/build-deploy/blob/master/docs/start.md))
`CurseForge`
Deploy to Curseforge. You must supply a `mod-id` which is the numeric ID of the project, as shown on the mod's webpage. You must provide the CurseForge-generated Oauth token (see [Getting Started](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/build-deploy/blob/master/docs/start.md))
`GitHub`
Deploy to GitHub releases. You must supply appropriate GitHub user information (see [Getting Started](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/build-deploy/blob/master/docs/start.md)). You can optionally provide a `branch` to release on (defaults to "master").

```


## `ModNameHere.version`

This is a standard .version file of the AVC specification. It is compatible with KSP-AVC and MiniAVC. The deploy scripts in this package use this to determine what the version of your mod is, as well as what versions of KSP it is compatible with. Here are the important parameters

`NAME`

This should match the name in the `.mod_data.yml` file.

`VERSION`

Make sure this block is incremented every time you release. It is used to tell the deploy providers what version your mod is and generate the filename for the zip. 

`KSP_VERSION`

This tells the providers what KSP version this was built for. If it was built for 1.6.1, put that here. It will be entered on SpaceDock, Curse, etc

Example file.
```

## `.travis.yml`

You shouldn't need to change this much unless using S3 deploys. Check the commented lines for possible pitfalls
